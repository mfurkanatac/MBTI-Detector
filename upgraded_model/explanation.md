# Explanation

I was able to find two datasets, one from kaggle and from the discussions in kaggle, pointing to a bigger dataset. Since the development was not enough in my eyes, I thought I could upgrade the model with this two.

Boy was I wrong. The old dataset that I had had dropped accuracy, it did not like the new model. However the new ones performed way better, and I painfully learned that each dataset used in a model gets the model specified to that dataset. 

Experience was still fun, I will upload each and every file in here
