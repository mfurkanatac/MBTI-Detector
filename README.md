# MBTI-Detector
An NLP tool that will classify your MBTI based on the text you input


This is an ongoing project started at 30th of March. It basically consists of 4 steps:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Choosing a model
- Improving the accuracy
- Creating an interface for people to interact with the AI


There will be seperate readme files inside every work folder, I have seperated them because even if I believe that its just better to click once and see everything working, it is not beneficial to learn at all. I have suffered from many repositories who had almost no explanations as a junior dev and i now want to help people who are new to AI and want to build a project like mine. 

Thank you in advance.
